## File Summaries

### `internal\tree\tree.go`
**Walker Functionality in `tree.go`**

The provided code file `internal/tree/tree.go` contains a directory tree walker implementation in Go. The walker is responsible for traversing the directory structure and generating a string representation of the tree.

**Key Functions:**

1. **`Generate`**: This function takes in the base path, a list of all discovered files, all discovered directories, and a list of relevant files. It creates a map of nodes representing the directory tree and generates the string representation.
2. **`buildTreeString`**: This recursive function is used to build the string representation of the directory tree. It takes in a node, prefix, and builder, and appends the node's name and path to the builder.

**Walker Pattern:**

The walker pattern is implemented using a recursive approach. The `Generate` function creates a map of nodes representing the directory tree, where each node has a name, path, and children. The `buildTreeString` function recursively traverses the tree, building the string representation by appending the node's name and path to the builder.

**Key Details:**

* The walker uses a map of nodes to quickly look up relevant files.
* It sorts the children at each level using the `sort.Slice` function.
* Relevant files are marked with an asterisk (`(*)`) in the generated string representation.
* The walker assumes that parent directories are always reported by the walker, and creates implicit parent directory nodes if necessary.

**Query Summary:**

The walker functionality in `tree.go` is designed to traverse a directory structure and generate a string representation of the tree. It uses a recursive approach and employs a map of nodes to efficiently look up relevant files. The walker pattern is implemented using the `Generate` and `buildTreeString` functions, which work together to build the string representation of the directory tree.

### `internal\walker\walker.go`
**Summary of Walker Functionality**

The `Walk` function in the provided code is responsible for traversing a directory structure based on the provided options and yielding results for each file/directory encountered after filtering.

**Key Components:**

1. **Options**: The `Options` struct defines the configuration for the directory walk, including the target path and ignore patterns.
2. **Result**: The `Result` struct holds information about a processed file or directory, including its path, whether it's a directory, and any error encountered while accessing the path.
3. **Walk Function**: The `Walk` function takes an `Options` object as input and returns a channel of `Result` objects.

**How Walker Works:**

1. The `Walk` function combines default ignore patterns with user-provided patterns to create a comprehensive set of ignore rules.
2. It uses the `os.DirFS` function to create a filesystem to walk, which is then used to traverse the directory structure using `fs.WalkDir`.
3. For each file/directory encountered, it checks against the ignore patterns using `doublestar.Match`. If a match is found, the result is skipped.
4. The result is sent back through the channel as a `Result` object, which includes the relative path of the file/directory and any error encountered while accessing the path.

**Relevant Patterns:**

1. **Default Ignore Patterns**: A set of common patterns to ignore, including hidden folders, node modules, Git directories, and binary files.
2. **User-Provided Ignore Patterns**: The user can provide additional ignore patterns through the `Options` struct.

In summary, the `Walk` function provides a flexible way to traverse directory structures while ignoring specific files and directories based on predefined patterns.

### `main.go`
This code is designed to analyze a directory and its contents based on a given query. The analysis involves:

1. **Directory Walk**: The code uses a walker to traverse the directory and its subdirectories, ignoring certain files and directories as specified by the user.
2. **Relevance Identification**: After walking the directory, the code identifies relevant files that match the query using the `relevance` package. Relevant files are those that contain the query string or have a high relevance score based on their content.
3. **LLM Interaction**: The code uses an LLM (Large Language Model) provider to generate summaries for the identified relevant files. The LLM is configured with an API key, endpoint, model name, and other settings as provided by the user.
4. **Output Generation**: Finally, the code generates Markdown output based on the query, directory path, and LLM-generated summaries.

**Functions and Classes:**

* `walker.Walk`: Walks the directory and its subdirectories to identify relevant files.
* `relevance.IdentifyRelevantFiles`: Identifies relevant files that match the query based on their content.
* `llm.GenerateSummaries`: Generates summaries for the identified relevant files using an LLM provider.
* `output.GenerateMarkdown`: Generates Markdown output based on the query, directory path, and LLM-generated summaries.

**Patterns:**

* The code uses regular expressions to ignore certain files and directories as specified by the user.
* The `relevance` package uses a scoring system to determine the relevance of each file based on its content.

**User Query Details:**

* The user query is passed to the `IdentifyRelevantFiles` function, which returns a list of relevant files that match the query.
* The LLM provider generates summaries for these relevant files based on their content and the query string.

Overall, this code provides an efficient way to analyze a directory and its contents based on a given query, using both natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.
