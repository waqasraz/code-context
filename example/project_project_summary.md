### internal\relevance\embedding.go

**Query Analysis: Relevance Logic**

The provided Go code implements a relevance logic for searching files based on user queries. The main functions involved in this analysis are:

1. `extractKeywords`: extracts meaningful keywords from a query (not shown in the provided code snippet, but assumed to exist earlier).
2. `getPathRelevanceScore`: calculates a score based on path matching, which is used in the hybrid approach.
3. `scoreFile`: scores a file based on its content and relevance to the query (not shown in the provided code snippet, but assumed to exist earlier).

The main functions related to the user's query are:

1. `getRelevanceScore`:
	* Calls `extractKeywords` to extract keywords from the query.
	* Iterates through a list of candidate files (`embeddingOpts.CandidateFiles`) and calculates their relevance scores using the following formula: `(embeddingScore * 0.7) + (keywordScore * 0.2) + (pathRelevance * 0.1)`.
	* Assigns a score to each file based on its relevance to the query.
2. `getHybridRelevanceScore`:
	* Calls `getPathRelevanceScore` to calculate path relevance scores for each candidate file.
	* Iterates through the same list of candidate files and calculates their combined scores using the formula above.

The code uses a hybrid approach, which combines two different scoring methods:

1. **Embedding-based score**: measures the similarity between the query and the file's content (using cosine similarity).
2. **Keyword-based score**: measures the presence of keywords in the file's name, path, or content.
3. **Path relevance score**: measures the similarity between the query and the file's path.

The final scores are combined using weights assigned to each scoring method (0.7 for embedding-based, 0.2 for keyword-based, and 0.1 for path relevance). The files with the highest combined scores are returned as the most relevant results.

### internal\relevance\relevance.go

**Summary of Relevance Project**

The project is designed to identify files most relevant to a given user query. The system analyzes potential files in a specified root path and scores them based on keyword matching.

**Key Functions and Classes Relating to Query Analysis**

1. **`IdentifyRelevantFiles`**: This function takes an `Options` struct as input, which includes the user query, target path, candidate files, and maximum number of files to return. It extracts keywords from the query using the `extractKeywords` function and scores each file based on keyword matching.
2. **`extractKeywords`**: This function splits the query into words, filters out common words and very short words, and returns a list of meaningful keywords.
3. **`scoreFile`**: This function opens a file, reads it line by line, and checks for each keyword in the query. It scores the file based on keyword occurrence and line position.

**Query Analysis Process**

The system follows these steps:

1. Extracts keywords from the user query using `extractKeywords`.
2. Scores each candidate file based on keyword matching using `scoreFile`.
3. Sorts files by score in descending order using `sortFilesByScore`.
4. Returns a list of top-scoring files, limited to the maximum number specified in the `Options` struct.

**Relevant Details**

* The system uses a simple heuristic to extract keywords from the query, which may not capture nuanced queries.
* The scoring function gives more weight to keyword occurrences near the beginning of the file.
* The system has a default configuration for maximum files to return, which can be overridden by the user.

	* `basePath`: the root directory path.
	* `allFiles`: a list of all discovered file paths.
	* `allDirs`: a list of all discovered directory paths.
	* `relevantFiles`: a list of files that are relevant to the query.

The function creates a string representation of the directory tree, including directories and files. It uses a recursive approach to build the tree structure.

2. **`buildTreeString` function:** This is a helper function used by `Generate` to recursively build the string representation of the directory tree.

**Patterns and Data Structures:**

1. **Directory Tree Data Structure:** The code defines a hierarchical data structure using the `Node` type, which represents directories and files with their respective paths, names, and flags (e.g., `IsDir`, `Relevant`).
2. **Recursive Approach:** The code uses a recursive approach to build the directory tree string representation, starting from the root node and traversing down to child nodes.

**Output:**

The generated output is a string representation of the directory tree, including directories and files, with relevant information (e.g., file contents). The output format appears to be a formatted text representation, possibly suitable for display in a terminal or CLI application.

### internal\walker\walker.go

**Project Summary**

The provided Go code file (`walker.go`) implements a directory walker utility, which traverses a specified directory structure and yields information about each processed file or directory.

**Key Functions and Classes**

*   `Walk`: The main function that takes an `Options` struct as input. It returns a channel of `Result` objects, where each object contains the path, whether it's a directory, and any error encountered while accessing the path.
*   `Options`: A struct that defines the configuration for the directory walk. It includes fields for the target path and ignore patterns.
*   `Result`: A struct that holds information about a processed file or directory, including its path, whether it's a directory, and any error encountered.

**Directory Walk Logic**

The code uses the `fs.WalkDir` function to traverse the directory structure. It combines default ignore patterns with user-provided patterns using the `append` function. The walk logic checks each entry against the ignore patterns using the `doublestar.Match` function for globbing and pattern matching.

When a match is found, the code skips the entire directory if it's a directory itself or skips the file if it's not. If no match is found, the result is sent to the output channel with the relative path.

**Error Handling**

The code handles errors that occur during the walk by sending an error message as part of the `Result` object. It also logs warnings for cases where making a path relative fails.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and configurable way to traverse directory structures and yield information about each processed file or directory.
